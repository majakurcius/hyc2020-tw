# Checkers testing 

The puprose of this file is to play around with the checkers run on pull requests (PRs) nad demonstrate how they work. 

# Typos

The spelling checker can take into account a specific language variant and mark spellings correct for other variants as typos. For example, the past form of the verb `cancel` is spelled `cancelled` in British English, but `canceled` in American English. 
Another example woudld be `behaviour` (BrE) vs. `behavior` (AmE).

# Dead links

One of the checkers defined for this repository can also check for [dead links](https://dead.links), i.e. verify that all the links work and link those that don't.
To learn more about dead links, [Google](https://google.com) the topic.
